		<a name="eztoc23508002_0_1" id="eztoc23508002_0_1"></a><h3>1. Scope of the Candidate CubeSat</h3><p>The new edition of the Fly Your Satellite! programme is open to university student teams from an <a href="../ESA_Member_States_Canada_Latvia_and_Slovenia.html" target="_blank">eligible state</a>, working on a one-, two- or three-unit CubeSat that have already manufactured and tested the CubeSat subsystems, and are ready to proceed to the satellite integration shortly after being accepted to the programme.</p><p>The scope of the proposed CubeSat mission shall be <b>educational</b>, and the proposal shall clarify in which way the educational objectives will be pursued.</p><p>Student team members are encouraged to prepare theses on subjects (e.g., technological, engineering, scientific…) related to their CubeSat mission. This shall be reflected in the proposal, and ESA will consider it as an educational asset.</p><p>The proposal shall also highlight the mission objectives of the CubeSat (for instance technological experiments, scientific research or other).</p><p>The baseline status for CubeSat teams in this entry level is listed below. ESA Education encourages teams to submit proposals even if they do not meet all the below points:</p>
<ol>

<li>The project is compatible with the “FYS Design Specification version 4” requirements and compliance is supported by datasheets, analysis, test reports, etc.</li>

<li>Subsystems have been functionally, and performance tested and preferably qualified.</li>

<li>All items for QM or PFM (depending on the model philosophy) have been procured.</li>

<li>Software has been developed and tested in an integrated configuration, e.g. FlatSat or stack testing.</li>

<li>CubeSat final Assembly &amp; Integration can finish within 6 months from Selection, and functional and mission/day-in-the-life tests can begin shortly after.</li>

<li>A clear AIV programme and schedule exists and is coherent with the scope of the mission and the model philosophy</li>

<li>Legal and regulatory obligations (e.g. ITU registration, IARU coordination, mission authorisation, insurance, etc.) have been considered and confirmation of compliance to those may be expected soon.</li>

</ol>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b><br />For the current call, launch opportunities to LEO (Low Earth Orbit) compatible with Space Debris Mitigation requirements on orbital lifetime are envisioned. Teams should indicate in their CubeSat Proposal the range of orbits to which they are compatible in terms of mission objectives, ground coverage, system performance, etc.&nbsp; Flexibility to several orbits is recommended as CubeSats often fly on rideshare missions or as piggyback payloads and teams should be prepared to accept deployments from orbits that deviate from their optimal performance orbit.</p><a name="eztoc23508002_0_2" id="eztoc23508002_0_2"></a><h3>2. Team Composition</h3><p>The opportunity is open to teams from universities of an <a href="../ESA_Member_States_Canada_Latvia_Lithuania_and_Slovenia.html" target="_blank">eligible state</a>. The applicants shall be a university team that includes:&nbsp;</p><p>A core team of <b>minimum&nbsp;8 students&nbsp;</b>complying with the eligibility criteria.</p>
<ul>

<li>Of these 8, a&nbsp;<b>minimum&nbsp;</b>of&nbsp;<b>4 student team members&nbsp;</b>shall be at&nbsp;<b>master&nbsp;</b>or&nbsp;<b>PhD level</b>.</li>

<li>The core student team (as specified above) and all students receiving sponsorship or training from the ESA Education Office must comply with the following eligibility criteria:
<ul>

<li>Enrolled as a full-time bachelor, master or PhD student (or equivalent)&nbsp;at a university of an eligible state</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>The number of student team members may be extended during the project lifetime. There is no limit to the maximum number of student team members.</li>

<li>CubeSat teams may include a limited number of students that do not comply with the eligibility criteria above, but those students will not be supported by ESA for participation in programme events, nor for training.</li>

</ul>
<p>In addition, a&nbsp;<b>minimum&nbsp;</b>of&nbsp;<b>2 supervisors shall&nbsp;</b>cover these three functions:</p>
<ul>

<li>An endorsing professor, responsible for the CubeSat project, endorsing the CubeSat proposal on behalf of the university;</li>

<li>A team leader (the professor, PhD student, or an assistant of the university) coordinating the project at system level and ensuring the milestones and deadlines of the FYS programme are met;</li>

<li>A system engineer (the team leader, or a PhD student from the same university as the team leader);</li>

<li>The key roles of team leader and system engineer must be undertaken by citizens of an <a href="../ESA_Member_States_Canada_Latvia_Lithuania_and_Slovenia.html" target="_blank">eligible state</a>.</li>

</ul>

ESA may ask the university teams to provide evidence of their compliance to the eligibility criteria at any time during the project.</p><a name="eztoc23508002_0_3" id="eztoc23508002_0_3"></a><h3>3. Project Funding</h3><p>The teams participating in the Fly Your Satellite! programme shall rely on their own sponsors to fund the complete development of their satellite and ground station.</p><p>The student teams shall also rely on their own independent funding to support the satellite operations.</p><p>A letter from authorities of the university confirming that the funds necessary to build and operate the CubeSat (if selected to FYS) will be available shall be attached to the online submission form.</p><p>The CubeSat Proposal shall reflect how the funding matches the estimated costs of the CubeSat development, including margins.</p><a name="eztoc23508002_0_4" id="eztoc23508002_0_4"></a><h3>4. ESA Sponsorship</h3><p>Students who may directly benefit from the different forms of sponsorship that the ESA Education Office will offer must comply with the eligibility criteria. Students that do not meet the eligibility criteria cannot be sponsored by the ESA Education Office.</p><p>ESA contribution in the support of the participating CubeSat student teams will include the following:</p>
<ul>

<li>Support offered by the ESA Education personnel that run the programme, and by the ESA specialists who will lecture, follow up, and review the student activities;&nbsp;</li>

<li>Access to and use of test facilities;</li>

<li>Student sponsorship for travel and accommodation for the participation in ESA workshops and training courses, reviews of the “Fly Your Satellite!” programme, test and launch campaigns;</li>
