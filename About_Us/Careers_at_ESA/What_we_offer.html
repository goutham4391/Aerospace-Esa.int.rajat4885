		<a name="eztoc22362943_1" id="eztoc22362943_1"></a><h2>ESA contracts</h2><p>Most ESA positions are permanent. This means that the contract is for an initial period of four years, after which it can be extended indefinitely, i.e. up to the ESA retirement age of 63.</p><p>Some positions are temporary and therefore the contract is for a fixed duration, which may be extended for a further period. If a position is temporary, this will be specified in the vacancy notice together with the foreseen duration of the contract.</p><p>The duties of staff members of the Agency are international in character; staff members shall carry out their duties and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Agency always in mind. In this respect, they are subject to the authority of the Director General. They shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any government, authority, organisation or person external to the Agency.</p><a name="eztoc22362943_2" id="eztoc22362943_2"></a><h2>Salaries</h2><p>ESA offers competitive salaries as a recognised intergovernmental organisation and, together with other international organisations such as the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, it is part of the Co-ordinated Organisation system.</p><p><a href="https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/careers/Table_Staff_Salaries.pdf">ESA salaries</a> are exempt from national income tax in ESA Member States, in line with Annex I of the ESA Convention.</p><p>The majority of ESA positions fall into two grade categories (A or B) which are assigned according to the duties and responsibilities and the level of qualifications required. Most positions are A grade (usually A2-A4) and involve either scientific or engineering activities or professional administration relating to law, finance, contracts or administration. B grade positions are mainly for secretarial, administrative or technical support activities.</p><p>These grades also have different levels of educational requirement. For instance, all A grade positions require a Master’s degree. The educational requirements for B grade positions depend upon the level within the B grade structure and are specified in the vacancy notice.</p>	</div>
