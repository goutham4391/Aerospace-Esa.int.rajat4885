Erdbeobachtungssatelliten werden zur Wettervorhersage, zur Beantwortung wichtiger geowissenschaftlicher Fragen, zur Verbesserung der Landwirtschaft, zur Sicherheit auf See, zur Hilfe im Katastrophenfall und für verschiedene alltägliche Anwendungen eingesetzt. Daniel Mesples und Robert Meisner von der ESA werden zusammen mit Susanne Dieterle und Timo Hanschmann von EUMETSAT erklären, wie die Erdbeobachtung einen objektiven Abdeckungsbereich über Raum und Zeit bietet, und den bevorstehenden Start des ersten Meteosat-Satelliten der dritten Generation thematisieren.</p>

In this programme, relive the slow and meticulous tasks a spacewalker must carry out including, on this occasion, some works on the European Robotic Arm. Rough Cut is the programme that lets you immerse yourself into key moments, without any commentary nor music. Only natural sounds and often, just the silence of our Universe.</p>

Thomas vous fait visiter la station en français et répond aux questions des journalistes. Vous aimez les astronautes et les datas ? Ne manquez pas, dans ce programme, quatre épisodes de la série animée ‘Dastronautes’ réalisée par le Centre National d’Études Spatial (CNES). Au menu également, le Centre français répond à la question : est-ce la fin de l’SS ? Les activités de l’ESA dans le domaine climatique et de la recherche de vie sur Mars sont éclairées par des reportages Euronews/ESA. Et on vous dit tout sur le problème des débris dans l’espace - car pour garantir l’accès à l’espace pour les générations futures, il est temps d’agir !</p>

								<p class="description">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.

								<p class="description">Immerse yourself in an astronaut’s journey from Earth to the International Space Station. Rough Cut brings you up close to the key moments of a launch – without the loud music and usual commentaries. Follow ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti as she waves goodbye to her loved ones, steps into the Crew Dragon capsule with three fellow NASA astronauts and feels the first effects of the launch and weightlessness. Stay with her when she finally enters the hatch of the International Space Station after a transit of just under 24 hours, and greets another ESA astronaut, Matthias Maurer – all in zero gravity.</p>

After years in development, a more powerful version of the Vega launcher, Vega-C, made its debut and completed its inaugural flight in July 2022. Meanwhile, Ariane 6 is currently undergoing combined tests at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou. Both new rockets will ensure Europe’s independent access to space and will enable the continent to maintain leadership in the fast-changing commercial launch service market. In this programme, re-live the launch of Vega-C and hear from the people involved in its development.  Get a sneak peek into what the future looks like with the Vega-Evolution rocket, while the first reusable spacecraft, Space Rider, is getting ready for its first flight in 2023. Finally, we take you on a tour of Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, where both Vega-C and the Ariane rockets are being launched.</p>

A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.

								<p class="description">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

It isn’t about the liquid element you extract from fruits, but the one present around the largest planet in our solar system : Jupiter ! Its moons are thought to harbour vast quantities of water below their icy surface. A new spacecraft developed by ESA will enable us to explore the gas giant and better understand the habitability of these icy worlds. Blasting off in 2022, the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will study the planet and three of its largest moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. In this atmospheric documentary, follow the building of the spacecraft and hear from the people involved.</p>

Watch them recall the best moments of their time on board, including filming strikes from thunderstorms on Earth from the ISS cupola or even dressing up for Halloween. Finally, they share their thoughts on what space exploration might look like in the next 20 years.</p>

Les activités de l’ESA dans le domaine climatique et de la recherche de vie sur Mars sont éclairées par des reportages Euronews/ESA. Et on vous dit tout sur le problème des débris dans l’espace - car pour garantir l’accès à l’espace pour les générations futures, il est temps d’agir !</p>

								<p class="description">About 70% of our planet is made of water. While fresh water sustains life on Earth, it is also essential for living in space. In this new documentary, ESA astronaut Andre Kuipers recounts his experience living in orbit and looking at the blue face of ‘Planet Aqua’. What observations can astronauts and divers share when it comes to water? How do satellites track marine litter? And how are spacecraft-grade recycling systems being used back down on Earth? Watch to get all the answers.</p>

We follow ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst on an expedition to retrieve meteorites from the ice. And a leading climate scientist delves into how and why the ice is melting fast not just in Antarctica, but all around the world.</p>

Watch them recall the best moments of their time on board, including filming strikes from thunderstorms on Earth from the ISS cupola or even dressing up for Halloween. Finally, they share their thoughts on what space exploration might look like in the next 20 years.</p>

								<p class="description">The world is heating up, and it appears to be due to our actions. According to scientists, we are living through the largest climate change since the end of the last ice age, 10 000 years ago. Its consequences are already being felt across the globe: shrinking glaciers, rising sea levels, changes in atmospheric composition. So how can space support the efforts to curb global warming? In this programme, learn how data from ESA satellites orbiting the Earth can provide precious information for decision-makers on key components of the climate system – from mapping the world’s forest to measuring the melting of ice sheets.</p>

Initial observations showed 2021 QM1 – the asteroid’s official name – had a chance of striking Earth in 2052, but it soon became invisible as the Sun’s glare got in the way of observations and the asteroid moved away from Earth. Rosa investigates and meets the real people in charge of scrutinising our skies: the asteroid hunters from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.</p>
